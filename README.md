# Implementation-of-Genetic-Algorithm

Genetic Algorithm is based on notion of natural selection. The offspring inherits the characteristics of the parents which are passed on to the subsequent generations. Given a problem statement which needs to be solved using Genetic Algorithm, we first need to decide these characteristics and then proceed.

Five phases that are considered in a genetic algorithm  are:

    Initial population
    Fitness function
    Selection
    Crossover
    Mutation
